Making complex big data problems into insightful and implementable solutions with ML and Statistics.

When the time came to choose a career during the last semesters of undergrad, I was only presented with options that would have me leave behind either my experience as a Mathematician or a Programmer. Not wanting to abandon either one of my core attributes, I discovered a field that would allow me to apply knowledge from both fields, one that requires  a combination of Mathematics and Computer Science. Data Science has been all I have wanted to apply and learn since then. 

One of the most common misconceptions of Data Science is that its sole focus is building accurate models. However, it is much more than that, as there are numerous specializations like ML Operations, Statistics and Big Data Analytics that are necessary to complete the Data Science Pipeline. A good Data Scientist might be familiar with all or an expert in one of these fields, but it is my goal to become an expert in the whole pipeline from Data Mining to Model Implementation. 
	
In a world made up of data, the applications of Data Science are limitless. In my positions, I have been able to work with data coming from factory tools, finance departments, and psychological studies with the goal of providing analytical insights and smart business decisions. 

While working at Western Digital, my main focus is working with factory teams from Southeast Asia. Here, I have created and implemented different models that found anomalies time series data that prevented damaged parts being produced. Furthermore, I have found opportunities in unstructured data where Data Science can bring in value to the company while working with the customers to evaluate and coordinate solutions to these business opportunities. 

Competencies: Data Science, Machine Learning, Hadoop, Spark, Python, Business Analytics, Customer Communication.
